# WP_Portfolio

Portfolio Repository
This repository contains my academic, design, and technical work completed as part of my undergraduate learning journey. It brings together major projects, research assignments, and practical experiments that reflect my growth in design thinking, problem-solving, and technical implementation.
Overview
The portfolio is organised to present a clear picture of:
My approach to understanding problems
The methods and frameworks I apply
The outcomes of my design and development processes
The progress I have made as a learner
Each section of this repository documents not only the final outputs but also the reasoning, decisions, and iterations that shaped them.
Included Work
1. UX / UI Design Projects
This section includes my complete design-thinking documentation such as user personas, journey maps, wireframes (low-fidelity and high-fidelity), and case studies. These projects highlight my ability to combine research insights with structured design workflows.
2. “MODIFY” – AI + Psychology Project
A detailed project that explores mood-based music recommendations using user-provided inputs.
This section includes:
Concept explanation
Self-perception analysis framework
System design and algorithms
Data flow explanation
Sample inputs and outputs
Project report
3. Web Programming Projects
This includes the QR Encode–Decode Portal and other coursework-based web development projects.
The files cover:
Complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation
Clean and simple UI
Functionality for generating and decoding QR codes
4. Academic and Research Work
This section contains reflective assignments, communication skill modules, and my Personal Growth Portfolio. These documents capture my progress in professional and interpersonal skills.
5. Technical Documentation
Reports, explanations, and design-based technical writing created for academic submissions. All documentation is written with clarity and structure to ensure ease of understanding.
Purpose of This Repository
The aim of this portfolio is to present my work in a transparent and organised manner. I have tried to show not only what I created, but how I approached each task—my thought process, learning curve, and the improvements that followed.
This repository serves as:
A record of my academic development
A demonstration of my design and technical strengths
A reflection of my ability to connect psychology, design, and technology
A reference for faculty, peers, and future collaborators
